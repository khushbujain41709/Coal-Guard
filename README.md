# CoalGuard: Real-Time Monitoring of Coal Transportation

## Problem Statement :-

Coal theft during transportation poses significant challenges to the mining industry, leading to substantial financial losses and operational inefficiencies. Criminals often tamper with coal loads by adding water, which maintains the overall weight and makes detection difficult with traditional monitoring methods. Existing systems are often manual or limited in scope, lacking the capability for real-time tracking, load monitoring, and anomaly detection.

**Key Issues:**
- Increased financial losses due to coal theft.
- Inadequate monitoring methods fail to detect tampering effectively.
- Lack of accountability and transparency in coal transportation.
- The absence of real-time tracking and anomaly detection exacerbates vulnerabilities.

The industry requires an advanced solution that leverages technology to enhance security and efficiency in coal transportation.

## Proposed Solution

**CoalGuard** aims to combat coal theft and enhance monitoring of coal transportation using an IoT-based approach without the need for hardware components. The solution integrates the following features:

1. **Real-Time GPS Tracking:**
   - Monitor the location of coal trucks in real time to ensure they remain on designated routes.

2. **Load Weight Monitoring:**
   - Implement a system to record load weights, enabling comparison to expected values to detect anomalies.

3. **Environmental Sensors Simulation:**
   - Generate synthetic data from environmental sensors to simulate conditions that indicate tampering, such as moisture levels, humidity, and temperature changes.

4. **Anomaly Detection:**
   - Utilize machine learning algorithms to identify abnormal patterns in the data that may suggest tampering (e.g., sudden increases in moisture levels or drops in temperature).

5. **Data Analytics Dashboard:**
   - Develop a centralized dashboard to visualize transportation patterns, monitor loads, and receive automated alerts for potential theft.

6. **Improved Accountability:**
   - Enhance transparency and accountability throughout the transportation process by documenting all relevant data and alerts.

## Impact

- **Reduced Theft:** Significant decrease in coal theft incidents through real-time monitoring and immediate alerts.
- **Increased Efficiency:** Streamlined operations and improved accountability through load verification.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Valuable insights into transportation patterns for informed decision-making and resource allocation.
- **Enhanced Security:** Continuous monitoring and alerts to improve overall security and increase trust among stakeholders.
